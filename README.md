# Compsci280Assignment2
This is simply an archive of some code I did in University of Auckland. The code may not work as it missing some modules. 
Some of the functions require school databases which may be long gone. 
To recap, this is explicitly for archival purposes. I don't expect anyone to run this.

Oh no. Why didn't I archive my later iterations of the code? I lost the files where I developed this to have a proper GUI.
It's fine, it's not going to work anyways because of the missing modules and the non existent database. I have other projects to develop.
